Instructions
Scenario: You are building a calculator for an online math game. The
calculator must include functionality to perform the following:

● Absolute Value Calculation: Given any number, return its absolute
value.
● Power Calculation: Calculate and return the value of a base raised to
a specific power.
● Square Root Finder: Calculate the square root of a number.
● Maximum and Minimum Finder: From a given set of numbers,
determine the largest and smallest values.
● Random Number Generator: Generate a random integer within a
specified range.
● Custom Rounding: Round a number to a specified number of decimal
places.

Step-by-Step Tasks:
1. Write a function for each operation listed above using the Math
module.
2. Test each function with sample inputs to ensure it works as intended.
3. Combine the individual functions into a single "calculator" program
where the user can select an operation and input the required values.
4. Test the calculator by performing the following:
● Find the absolute value of -45.67.
● Raise 5 to the power of 3.
● Calculate the square root of 144.
● Determine the largest and smallest values from [3, 78, -12,
0.5, 27].
● Generate a random number between 1 and 50.
● Round 23.67891 to 2 decimal places.
